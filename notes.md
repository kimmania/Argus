Commands:
To Build: docker build -t argus .
Run interactive: docker run -it --name argus argus
  Note: The above line puts you right at the cmd of the running argus application
        Enter a number for executing the possible options
        exit to exit out of the interactive session/stops the container
If you also want to connect to the console: 
  docker run -it --name argus argus
